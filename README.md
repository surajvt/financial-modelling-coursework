# 📊 Portfolio Optimization and Risk Analysis  

This project is part of the **MSc FinTech & Policy** coursework at the University of Surrey.  
It applies **financial modelling**, **portfolio optimization**, and **risk management** techniques using real-world market data from Bloomberg.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Build a diversified investment portfolio using equity, bond, and index instruments.  
2. Determine **optimal portfolio weights** based on historical performance and risk-return trade-offs.  
3. Estimate **Value at Risk (VaR)** at a 95% confidence level using normal distribution approximation.  
4. Implement **GARCH models** to account for time-varying volatility in portfolio returns.
